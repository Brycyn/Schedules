# Practice React Project

## About

This React Project is a project that I am using to sharpen my skills in React. I have set up a Google Cloud Developer account that is connected to this project. This allows me to make queries into the Google CLoud and retireve informaition from Users that are approved/ logged in. Rigth now I am only fetching and Creating google calendar events.

Over the last 7 months, I have been spending my time working on the mobile app for a private Christian college using React Navite & Expo, but I wanted to be able to add React to my tool belt. I am recent Grad with a Bachelors in computer Science and an Associates in Business & Economics. As I continue to add to this project, feel free to leave tips or suggections as I am always looking to learn more!

## Pages

### Home Page

The Home Page is Currently Under Construction

### Wage Page

The wage page holds a list of all upcoming "shifts".

** Note: Shifts are pulled from google calender after sign in **

### Calendar Page

The calendar page is a simple calendar that fetches events from google after the user logs in with their google account.

## Authentication

The Authentication is handled with GoogleOAuthProvider.

Api calls are made with axios.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
